Plop
----
A small utility for generating object and variable dumps. PHP's built-in
print_r goes' haywire when using complex object graphs. It also outputs
directly to stdout by default.

Originally based off the code here: http://ca2.php.net/print_r#78851. Wrapped
up and packaged for the composer era.
